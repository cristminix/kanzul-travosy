git clone with noCheckout option
git checkout current file 

commit cant be specified by git add

but the whole of drectory list, instead of expected git add only, commit will
check the list of directory tree automatically, if they were deleted they are also added to git rm -> so to test if git rm called before we run commit, we can just modify the git remove command to another or our function to replace original git rm function
